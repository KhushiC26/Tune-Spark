        title: "Piano",
        description: `
          <strong>History:</strong> The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy. It evolved from earlier keyboard instruments like the harpsichord and clavichord. Unlike its predecessors, the piano allowed musicians to play both soft and loud sounds, hence the name "fortepiano," meaning "soft-loud."
          <br><br>
          <strong>How to Play:</strong> The piano is played by pressing keys on a keyboard, each of which is connected to a hammer that strikes strings inside the piano. To master the piano, one must learn proper finger placement, hand position, and use pedals for dynamics and sustain.

          <br><br>
          <strong>How to Play:</strong> The guitar is played by strumming or plucking the strings with fingers or a pick. The left hand presses the strings against the fretboard to form different notes and chords. Learning guitar involves developing finger strength and precision, as well as understanding musical notation and tablature.
